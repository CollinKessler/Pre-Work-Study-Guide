# Prework Study Guide

## This is a collection of notes taken during the Prework section of the KU Coding Bootcamp.

Before beginning the KU Coding Bootcamp, I needed a handy place to keep all the information I was learning, so I could refer back to it during the course.  I know that I benefit from having a refresher on-hand when learning a large amount of new information, so this study guide serves as a base from which to grow.

## Usage

This Guide is to be used to refer back to when you need a refresher on the core concepts you learned in the Prework section of the Bootcamp.  Return to it during the course, or any time you need more time with these concepts.  There are separate sections for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.  There is a JavaScript running in the Console that will pick a random section for you to study, if you're in a state, as you likely will be, where you just need someone else to tell you what to do.  We've all been there, girl.  It's gonna be ok.
